# This script can be used to run flutter test for a given directory (defaults to the current directory)
# It will exclude generated code and translations (mimicking the ci) and open the coverage report in a
# new window once it has run successfully.
#
# To run in current directory:
# ./run_test_with_coverage
#
# To run in other directory:
# ./run_test_with_coverage ./path/to/other/project
